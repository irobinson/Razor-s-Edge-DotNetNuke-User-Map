This is an entry for the DotNetNuke Hackathon on the Razor scripting language by Ian Robinson.

Razor's Edge User Map allows you to load your DotnetNuke user's locations on to a map dynamically based on the address in their user profile. It uses the razor scripting language to retrieve user data and display that data on the page. It then uses JavaScript to interact with the Google Geolocation API and the Google Maps API through a jQuery plug-in. It also uses modern W3C geolocation code to look up your current location and provide driving directions from that location.
